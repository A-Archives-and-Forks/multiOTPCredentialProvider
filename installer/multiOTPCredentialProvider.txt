LOCAL ONLY STRONG AUTHENTICATION INSTALLATION
=============================================
1) Install the multiOTP Credential Provider, which contains also multiOTP inside.
2) During the installation, specify the folder on the client where the
   multiotp.exe file and folders must be installed and configured.
3) In the wizard, leave the URL of the multiOTP server(s) empty.
4) You can also choose to require a strong authentication only for RDP.
5) When you are on the test page, open a command prompt in the folder where
   multiOTP is now installed and create a new local user. Example:
   1) *multiotp -fastcreatenopin my_user*
   2) *multiotp -qrcode my_user my_qrcode.png)*
6) If the test is successful, the Credential Provider is installed.
7) To disable the Credential Provider, uninstall it from Windows,
   or execute multiOTPCredentialProvider-unregister.reg


CENTRALIZED STRONG AUTHENTICATION INSTALLATION (with cache support)
===================================================================
1) First, install a multiOTP server (commercial or open source edition).
   (https://www.multiotp.com or https://www.multiotp.net)
2) On each client, install the multiOTP Credential Provider.
3) During the installation, specify the folder on the client where the
   multiotp.exe file and folders must be installed and configured.
4) In the wizard, type the URL of the multiOTP server(s).
5) You can also choose to require a strong authentication only for RDP.
6) On the test page, test your account to be sure that everything works.
7) If the test is successful, the Credential Provider is installed.
8) To disable the Credential Provider, uninstall it from Windows,
   or execute multiOTPCredentialProvider-unregister.reg


UNATTENDED INSTALLATION
=======================
An MSI file will be available soon to mass deploy the multiOTP Credential Provider.


UNINSTALLATION
==============
- Uninstall the multiOTP Credential Provider using the regular uninstallation procedure, or launch the file multiOTPCredentialProvider-unregister.reg (you must have administrator access).


TECHNICAL DETAILS
=================
- the credential provider DLL (multiOTPCredentialProvider.dll) is installed in the system folder \Windows\System32
- the credential provider options are stored in the following registry key
  (registry entries have priority over multiotp.ini file entries): HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{FCEFDFAB-B0A1-4C4D-8B2B-4FF4E0A3D978}
  - multiOTPCacheEnabled : [1|0], used directly by multiOTP
  - multiOTPDefaultPrefix : [Default computer/domain, default is '']. multiOTP use automatically the domain name as default, or computer
                            name if the computer is not in a domain. You can set here a manual default computer/domain, like for example '.'
  - multiOTPDisplaySmsLink : [0|1]
  - multiOTPLoginTitle : [Login title, default is '', which displays 'multiOTP Login']
  - multiOTPPath : [X:\Path\to\multiotp\folder]
  - multiOTPPrefixPass : [0|1]
  - multiOTPRDPOnly : [0|1]
  - multiOTPServers : [multiOTP server(s) to contact, default is 'https://192.168.1.88'], used directly by multiOTP
  - multiOTPServerTimeout : [timeout in seconds before switching to the next server, default is 5], used directly by multiOTP
  - multiOTPSharedSecret : [secret to connect this client to the server, default is 'ClientServerSecret'], used directly by multiOTP
  - multiOTPTimeout : [timeout in seconds, default is 60]
  - multiOTPUPNFormat : [0|1]
- if the tile file [multiOTPPath]\multiotp.bmp exists, it will replace the default 128x128 tile image
